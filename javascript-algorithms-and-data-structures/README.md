# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

I completed these projects to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

These're descriptions about the projects: 

### Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
***Assignment:*** Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

 ### Roman Numeral ConverterPassed
***Assignment:*** Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

### Caesars CipherPassed
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
***Assignment:*** Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

### Telephone Number Validator
***Assignment:*** Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

### Cash RegisterPassed
***Assignment:*** Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.
